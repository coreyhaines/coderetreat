[1] Spock: 

Spock is a testing and specification framework for Java and Groovy 
applications. What makes it stand out from the crowd is its beautiful and 
highly expressive specification language. Thanks to its JUnit runner, Spock is 
compatible with most IDEs, build tools, and continuous integration servers. 
Spock is inspired from JUnit, jMock, RSpec, Groovy, Scala, Vulcans, and other 
fascinating life forms.
