Simple Perl setup using modules and tests

To run the program: perl life.pl

To run tests: prove -l

Sample tests are included to demonstrate failing and passing.

See perldoc for Test::Simple and Test::Tutorial for details on
testing. If you find yourself needing more complex tests, have a look
at the Test::More module, a drop-in replacement for Test::Simple.
