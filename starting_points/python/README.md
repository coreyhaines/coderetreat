Python support including PyTDDmon [1]

Usage:

$ python pytddmon.py

Tests are evaluated by PyTDDmon automatically.

Another option is to perferm a direct execution:

$ python test_life.py

[1] PyTDDMon:

With pyTDDmon running in the background, you don’t need to switch between 
code editor and terminal (or test-runner-GUI), you just need to save your code 
or test file, and pyTDDmon notices that something changed. If all tests pass, 
pyTDDmon turns GREEN. If a single test fails, it turns RED. Otherwise – if 
there is some error in a code file, or more than one test fails etc. – it 
turns GRAY.
