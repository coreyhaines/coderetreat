A template project for Erlang using EUnit and Rebar.

You will need to have a standard installation of Erlang installed.

A version of Rebar that runs on OSX, and should also work on Linux is included in the root of the erlang project.

To run the tests, cd to the starting_points/erlang directory (the same directory that contains this file), and run

   ./rebar eunit
