## Scala Starting Point

Project files for the three most popular Scala IDEs (Eclipse,
NetBeans, and IntelliJ) are included with this starting point.
Instructions for each IDE are below.

In addition to the IDE project files, the starting point also includes
a [SBT](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki) build file and a 
[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) POM. If you prefer, feel free to use
the build systems directly (or to create your own IDE configuration).

This starting point includes the following libraries:

* [Scala 2.11.4](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
* [ScalaTest 2.2.1](http://scalatest.org/)
* [Specs 2.3.13](http://code.google.com/p/specs/)
* [JUnit 4.11](http://www.junit.org/) (for running tests in some of the IDEs)
