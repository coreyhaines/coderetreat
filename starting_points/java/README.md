Java Starting Point
-------------------

Project files for the three most popular Java IDEs (Eclipse,
NetBeans, and IntelliJ) are included with this starting point.
Instructions for each IDE are below.

In addition to the IDE project files, the starting point also includes
a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) POM. If you prefer, feel free to use Maven directly (or to
create our own IDE configuration).

This starting point includes the following libraries:

* [JUnit 4.8.2](http://www.junit.org/)
* [fest 1.4](http://code.google.com/p/fest/)
* [Mockito 1.8.5](http://code.google.com/p/mockito/)
