[1] Cucumber:

Cucumber lets software development teams describe how software should behave in
plain text. The text is written in a business-readable domain-specific language 
and serves as documentation, automated tests and development-aid - all rolled 
into one format.

Cucumber works with Ruby, Java, .NET, Flex or web applications written in any 
language. It has been translated to over 40 spoken languages.

Cucumber also supports more succinct tests in tables - similar to what FIT does. 
Dig around in the examples and documentation to learn more about Cucumber 
tables.
